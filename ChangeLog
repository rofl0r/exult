	* gamewin.cc: dirty fix to visual artifacting (see mailing list)
	* objs.cc: reverted anim. code to earlier state

	* usecode.cc: avoided Internal Compiler Error for gcc 2.95.2

2000-05-08  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@patches.simutech.com>

	* Pathfinding added to run_usecode().  Can be tested by
	double-clicking on a bucket.  Works, but needs refinement.

2000-05-07  Willem Jan Palenstijn <palenstijn@wanadoo.nl>
	* objs.cc: attempt at synching animations 

2000-05-03  Tristan Tarrant  <tarrant_tristan@emc.com>

	* gamewin.cc: Show game title in splash screen

	* exult.cc: you can now press 'i' to show the npc's inventories just
	like the real U7. Needs improvement.
	New shape browser: PgUp/PgDn selects file, sS selects shape, fF 
	selects frame. Also 'q' quits and ESC only closes gumps.

2000-05-02  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@patches.simutech.com>

	* Use data from 'ready.dat' to place objects on Actor.

2000-05-02  Tristan Tarrant  <tarrant_tristan@emc.com>

	identity.

2000-04-30  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

	* Show signs, books, and scrolls.
	* Create monsters, and have them loiter.

2000-04-28  Tristan Tarrant  <tarrant_tristan@emc.com>

	* Testing of CVS commit mails...
	* gamedat.cc, gamewin.h: implement get_game_identity
	* gamewin.cc, exult.cc: generate initial gamedat before opening window.
	Also if static and gamedat identities don't match, recreate gamedat.
	* autogen.sh: clear old generated files first
	* configure.in: if I don't have kmid build without it anyway, don't
	tell me to run configure with --disable-kmid

2000-04-26  Tristan Tarrant  <tarrant_tristan@emc.com>

	* exult.cc: Implement 'h' key to show a simple help page
	* .cvsignore: added cvsignore files everywhere
	* ChangeLog: started changelog using standard GNU notation. Emacs 
	has a major mode which enables easy editing of this beast.
	* autogen.sh: script which generates automake/autoconf stuff.
	* configure.in: should not use acinclude.m4 as AC_INIT. Use exult.cc 
	instead.
