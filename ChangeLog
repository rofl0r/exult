	no need to regenerate dependencies by hand, gcc dynamically does
	that, Makefile.am files are now much nicer and easier to maintain

	like the real U7. Needs improvement.

	selects frame. Also 'q' quits and ESC only closes gumps.

2000-05-02  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@patches.simutech.com>

	* gamewin.cc, exult.cc: generate initial gamedat before opening window.
	Also if static and gamedat identities don't match, recreate gamedat.

	* configure.in: if I don't have kmid build without it anyway, don't
	tell me to run configure with --disable-kmid

2000-04-26  Tristan Tarrant  <tarrant_tristan@emc.com>

	* exult.cc: Implement 'h' key to show a simple help page

	* configure.in: should not use acinclude.m4 as AC_INIT. Use exult.cc 
	instead.
