The GIMP shapes plug-in
=======================

This Plug-In is for the Windows Port of The Gimp. It is tested with the latest version (2.8.14).
With it you can edit *.shp files used by Exult and the original Ultima 7. This shapes are compressed into *.flx or *.vga files. Use expack from our tools download to extract the files.

Get the installer for The Gimp at http://www.gimp.org/downloads/

Install
=======

- Install the Gimp (example: C:\Program Files\GIMP 2)
- execute Gimp20Plugin.exe and choose C:\Program Files\GIMP 2\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins (if you installed the Gimp somewhere else, change accordingly) for extract path. If you extracted the file to some other directory copy u7shp.exe into that directory


Usage
=====
- Drag and drop *.shp files into the Gimp. You don't need to select a palette file (press either "Ok" or "Cancel").
- edit (see the Gimp manual on how to edit graphics)
- save

Notes
=====
- The Gimp already comes with our plug-in for shapes but uses a very old outdated version that can only do grey scales
- The Gimp plug-in is far superior to Photoshop/PaintShopPro as it can handle multiple images in one shape file. Also Photoshop/PSP can not handle indexed images with Alpha correctly.
