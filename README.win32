Exult instructions for Windows
------------------------------------

To play
---------
Copy exult.exe into your Ultima 7 directory.
If you are currently playing a game of Ultima 7, be sure 
 to remove the gamedat directory. (don't forget to back
 it up first...)
Run exult.exe
Have fun!


Notes
------
* As of version 0.26, the Windows port of Exult also has basic
support for MIDI and speech!

* Exult generates the files 'stdout.txt' and 'stderr.txt'.
These may give you some idea of what is going on
under the hood. When Exult suddenly quits, sometimes
these files can help.


To build
----------

Exult is originally a Linux project, using a platform
independent API called SDL. (Simple DirectMedia Layer)

Because of this, the Windows version has been built in
Linux, using the cross-compiler Mingw32.

Please note it is not necessary to build Exult yourself,
since the Windows executable is already included.

1) get and install Mingw32 and SDL.

SDL: http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/

Mingw32: http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/Xmingw32/

Installation instructions can be found on the same pages.
(make sure to build SDL for the cross compiler)

2) build exult:

configure --host=i386-linux --target=i386-mingw32 --enable-win32
make


It is possible that the linker complains it cannot find the
function 'SDL_MixAudio'.
If this is the case, you have to manually link Exult:
Copy the file SDL_mixer.o from the SDL source tree
(from SDL/src/audio) to your exult directory, and link
Exult using the exact same command line, but insert 
SDL_mixer.o somewhere between the other listed .o files.
(This will be fixed in a future release.)
 
3) copy exult.exe to your U7 directory, and run it!
If you are currently playing a game of Ultima 7, be sure
to make a backup of the gamedat directory.
 
4) Have fun :-)


Note: 
It is also possible to build Exult using the Windows version 
of Mingw32. (see www.mingw.org)
Since I have not yet tried this myself, I am unable to give
exact instructions for this.
