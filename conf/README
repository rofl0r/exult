What the hell am I?

I'm a simple XML syntax parser. Not a real XML parser. Nothing to do with DTD's.
Really speaking, what we do here is not XML. If it's anything it's DDL (Data
Description Language).

In short the base syntactical rules are the same as XML, giving us a
hierarchical file-structure of key-value pairs (just like the Windows(tm)
registry). As a bonus, it's human-readable, and human editable as well as
being a doddle to handle programmatically

This lends itself very nicely to configuration files, and that's _exactly_
what we're doing here.


** Warning **
Just at the moment, I'm not supporting:

* XML empty tags (I did, but I'm not right now)
* Spaces,tabs,carriage returns, line-feeds inside entities (just because)
