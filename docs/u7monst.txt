Most of the file formats I have figured out by looking at and modifying the 
files, then running the game to see what happens. Of course "looking" 
doesn't mean just with a hex editor; I write simple programs that print out 
files in a table format. On the other hand, egg fields were not too 
difficult because (as I think I have mentioned) Serpent Isle has a cheat 
where you can press F9 and click on an egg to see all its info. If you press 
F9 in the Black Gate you can click on any item but it won't show the 
egg-specific data.

I have also discovered the format of the EQUIP.DAT file, which tells the 
game which items are given to monsters when they are created by eggs. As is 
common with Ultima 7, the first byte is a count of how many records in the 
file, with each record being 60 bytes. A record is simply an array of 10 
elements of 6 bytes each, with each element describing a type of item:

16 bit integer: item shape
byte: probability that this item will be created
byte: the quantity of this item
16 bit integer: unused (always zero)

So a monster can be given up to 10 types of items, with unused elements 
having a shape number of zero (other fields are zero too). Note that the 
quantity can apply to items which do not normally have a quantity, e.g. 
gems. Now you must be wondering how these records correspond to each type of 
monster...

You already know the purpose of MONSTER.DAT and that there are 25 bytes per 
records. There is still a lot in this file to decipher, but here is what I 
know:

(You already know about these fields)
int16: monster shape
byte: strength (multiplied by 4?)
byte: dexterity (multiplied by 4?)
byte: intelligence (multiplied by 4?)
byte: combat_skill (multiplied by 4?)
byte: armour (I am doubtful about this one)
byte: unknown (always in the range [0,7])
byte: unknown (probably flags)
int16: ability flags
  bit 0: can fly
  bit 1: can swim
  bit 2: can walk
  bit 3: ethereal (can walk through walls)
  bit 4: unknown
  bit 5: unknown (only "gazer" and "Hook" have this set)
  bit 6: unused?
  bit 7: the monster can only be damaged by magical weapons
  bit 8: unknown (only "bat" has this set)
  bit 9: the monster moves very slowly (e.g. slime, corpser, etc)
  bit 10: unknown (only "skeleton" has this set)
  bits 11-15: unused?
3 bytes: unknown
byte: *** the index of the record in EQUIP.DAT
int16: unused (always zero)
int16: unknown
6 bytes: unused

From this you can see how to give items to newly spawned monsters (though 
this wouldn't really be useful until combat is implemented).
