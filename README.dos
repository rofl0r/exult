Exult now has been ported to MSDOS, and an MSDOS executable has been added
to the release.

Compilation is done using the same source and "makefile" as the Linux version,
using the DJGPP cross-compiler under Linux.

To run it, place "exult.exe" and "avatar.ttf" in the U7 top-level directory,
and run "exult".

For more information, refer to "README".
