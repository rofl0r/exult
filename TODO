Improve startup procedure
-------------------------
The problem at the moment (4th September 2000) is that Game_window is the main
class which takes care of most initialization. Unfortunately it tries to load
files from the "static" directory at construction, which is not good if we
want to use it for an "Exult menu".
This is how initialization of Exult should go:

	- Parse command line parameters
	- Read in configuration file
	- Init audio
	- Create Image_window()
	- Show Exult banner
	- Show Exult menu
		PLAY "ULTIMA VII - THE BLACK GATE" (only if setup)
		PLAY "ULTIMA VII PART 2 - SERPENT ISLE" (only if setup)
		SETUP EXULT -> PATHS, RES, AUDIO, etc.
		EXULT CREDITS
		EXULT QUOTES
		EXIT
	- Create game-dependent Game()
	- Create Game_window() applied on above Image_window
	- Go on as usual

Change font handling
--------------------
Font handling should be moved in a separate Font class
